.The simple way
****
- Download and experiment with this link:Radio.prj.xml[sample Tasker project].
- Or, extract this project from within the app itself.
****

.Alternatively, create a Tasker task as follows
****
- Create a new task.
- Add an action:
** select _Misc/Send Intent_.
- Under _Action_, insert the name of the intent.
- Leave _Cat_, _Mime Type_ and _Data_ at their default values; either
  `None` or empty.
- For the `PLAY` intent, under _Extra_ insert: +
   +
   `url: INSERT-YOUR-URL-HERE` +
   +
   and, under the second _Extra_, insert: +
   +
   `name: INSERT-YOUR-NAME-HERE` +
- Leave everything else empty, except ensure that the _Target_ is
  set to `Broadcast Receiver`.

Save the task and run it.

[TIP]
====
You can save on typing the long intent names (and possible typos) by using
the _Copy_ buttons within the app itself.
